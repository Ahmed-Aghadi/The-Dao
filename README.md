# The-Dao

It helps data dao to create complex bounties including multiple bounties which will ensure data to be stored concurrently for a longer perioud of time and also on the basis reputation of providers.

So a Proposal can be created in such a way that at a time only a particular number of deals can be active, so multiple deals can be active at a time which will make sure data is stored by multiple providers and also data will be stored for a much longer period of time as multiple bounties can be assigned to a proposal.

The DAO also stored reputation of each provider so a proposal of any data dao can add a condition that only those provider who have done 'x' deals in The DAO can participate in the bounty.
